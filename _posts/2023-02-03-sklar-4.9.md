## Probability of Symbol Error for MPSK

---

### Coherently detected $M$-ary PSK signaling

* Symbol error performance
* For large enegy-to-noise ratios
* For equally

$$
P_E(M)\approx2Q\left({\sqrt{2E_s\over{N_0}}\sin{\pi\over{M}}}\right)
$$

* $P_E(M)$: probability of symbol error
* $E_s=E_b(\log_2M)$: energy per symbol
* $M=2^k$: size of the symbol set

---

### Differentially coherent detection of $M$-ary DPSK

* For large $E_s/N_0$

$$
P_E(M)\approx2Q\left({\sqrt{2E_s\over{N_0}}}\sin{\pi\over{\sqrt{2}M}}\right)
$$

## Probability of Symbol Error for MFSK

---

### Coherently detected $M$-ary orthogonal signaling

* Symbol error performance

$$
P_E(M)\leq(M-1)Q\left({\sqrt{E_s\over{N_0}}}\right)
$$

### Noncoherently deteceted $M$-ary orthogonal signaling

* Symbol error performance

$$
P_E(M)={1\over{M}}\exp\left(-{E_s\over{N_0}}\right) \sum^M_{j=2}(-1)^j
\left({
    \begin{matrix}
        M \\
        j
    \end{matrix}}
\right) \exp\left({E_s\over{jN_0}}\right)
$$

$$
\left({
    \begin{matrix}
        M \\
        j
    \end{matrix}}
\right) = {M!\over{j!(M-j)!}}
$$

### Binary case

$$
P_B={1\over{2}}\exp{\left(-{E_b\over{2N_0}}\right)}
$$

## Bit Error Probability versus Symbol Error Probability for Orthogonal Signals

---

### $M$-ary orgthogonal signal set

* Relationship between probability of bir error and probability of symbol error

$$
{P_B\over{P_E}}={2^{k-1}\over{2^k-1}}={M/2\over{M-1}}
$$

* In the limit as $k$ increases

$$
\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}{P_B\over{P_E}}={1\over{2}}
$$

## Bit Error Probability versus Symbol Error Probability for Multiple Signaling

---

### Orthogonal signaling

* Each signal vector is not equidistant from all of the others.
* some symbol errors will usually result in two or more bit errors, even with a large signal-to-noise ratio.

---

### Nonorthogonal scheme

* Using a binary-to-$M$-ary code
  * binary sequences corresponding to adjacent symbols (phase shift) differ in only one bit position
  * When an $M$-ary symbol error occurs, it is more likely that only one of the $k$ input bits will be in error.

#### Gray Code

* A code that provides this desirable feature.
* The occurrence of a multibit error, for a given symbol error, is much reduced compared to the uncoded binary assignment.

$$
P_B\approx{P_E\over{\log_2M}}
$$
