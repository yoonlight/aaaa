## Introduction

---

### Channel that has memory
<!--
footer: Introduction
 -->

- feature
  - exhibits mutually dependent signal transmission impairments
- example
  - multipath fading
    - signals arrive at the receiver over two or more paths of different lengths
- effect
  - the signals can arrive out of phase with each other
  - the cumulative received signal is distorted
- suffer
  - wireless mobile communication channels
  - switching noise and other burst noise
- time-correlated impairments result in statistical dependence among successive symbol transmissions

---

### Interleaving

- coding techniques for channels with memory
- problem
  - the difficulty in obtaining accurate models of the often time-varing statistics of such channels
- technique **requires a knowledge of the duration or span of the channel of the channel memory**

---

### Interleaving Role

- Interleaving and deinterleaving causes bursts of channel errors to be spread out in time and thus to be handled by the decoder **as if they were random errors**.
- separate the codeword symbols in time
  - **separating the symbols in time** effectively **transforms a channel with memory to a memoryless channel**
  - **enables the random-error-correcting codes** to be useful in a burst-noise channel

### Interleavers types

- block interleavers
- convolutional interleavers

---

## Block Interleaving

- a block interleaver
  - accepts the coded symbols in blocks from the encoder
  - permutes the symbols
    - filling the columns of an MXN array with the encodede sequence
  - feeds the rearranged symbols to the modulator
    - the symbols are fed to the modulator one row at a time and transmitted over the channel
- at the receiver, the deinterleaver
  - performs the inverse operation
  - accepts the symbols from the demodulator
  - deinterleaves them
  - feeds them to the decoder
    - symbols are entered into the deinterleaver array by rows, and removed by columns

---

## Convolutional Interleaving

- the code symbols are sequentially shifted into the bank of N registers
- vs block interleaver
  - performance is similar to that of a block interleaver
  - there is a reduction of one-half in delay and memory over the block interleaving requirements

---

## Concatenated Codes

- a concatenated code is one that uses two leveles of coding, and inner code and an outer code
  - to achieve the desired error performance
- the inner code correct most of the channel errors
- the outer code reduces the probability of error to the specified level
- the primary reason for using a concatenated code is to achieve a low error rate with an overall implementation complexity which is less than that which would be required by a single coding operation
- one of the most popular concatenated coding systems
  - a Viterbi-decoded convolutional inner code and a Reed-Solomon (R-S) outer code
  - the concatenated system performance is severely degraded by correlated errors among successive symbols
  - Hence interleaving between codes at the symbol level needs to be provided
