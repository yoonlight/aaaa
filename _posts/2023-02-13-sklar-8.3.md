## Introduction

<!-- footer: introduction -->

### Channel

sources of channel errors

1. small unwnated particles or aire bubbles in the plastic material or pit inaccuracies arising in manufacturing
2. fingerprints or scratches during handling

the channel has a burstlike error behavior
a scratch or fingerprint will **cause several consecutive data samples to be in error**

---

### Cross-interleave Reed-Solomon code (CIRC)

a concatenated error-control scheme

the data are rearranged in time so that digits stemming from contiquous samples of the waveform are spread out in time
error bursts are made to appear as sigle random events
the digital information is protected by adding parity bytes derived in two Reed-Solomon (R-S) encoders

- correction and concealment of errors

### achieves its error control by a hierachy of techniques

1. The decoder provides a level of error correction
2. If the error correction capability is exceeded, the decoder provides a level of erasure correction
3. If the erasure correction capability is exceeded, the decoder attempts to conceal unreliable data by interpolating between reliable neighboring samples.
4. If the interpolation capability is exceeded, the decoder blanks out or mutes the system for the duration of the unreliable samples

## CIRC Encoding

### Five Encoding steps

- $\Delta$ interleave
  - this facilitates the interpolation process
- $C_2$ encode
- $D^*$ interleave
- $C_1$ encode
- $D$ interleave
