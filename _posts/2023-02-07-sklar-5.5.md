## Noise Figure

- it relates the SNR at the input of a network to the SNR at the output of the network
- it measures the SNR degradation caused by the network

$$
F={(\text{SNR})_{\text{in}}\over{(\text{SNR})_{\text{out}}}}={S_i/N_i\over{GS_i/G(N_i+N_{ai})}}
$$

- it is a parameter that expresses the noisiness of a two-port network or device compared with a reference noise source at the input port.

$$
F={N_i+N_{ai}\over{N_i}}=1+{N_{ai}\over{N_i}}
$$

- it expresses the noisiness of a network relative to an input source noise.

## Noise Temperature

### Effective noise temperature

$$
T^\degree_RW=(F-1)T^\degree_0
$$

- noise temperature has no such constraint
- the noisiness of an amplifier can be modeled as if it were caused by an additional noise source operating at some effective temperature called $T^\degree_R$

---

## Line Loss

- the difference between amplifier networks and lossy line networks
  - the degradation mechanims loss and noise

- Power loss

$$
L={\text{input power}\over{\text{output power}}}
$$

- Network gain: $G=1/L$
- Total output noise power flowing from the network into the load

$$
N_{\text{out}}=\kappa T^\degree_gW
$$

---

- Noise figure for a lossy line

$$
F=1+{T^\degree_L\over{290}}=L
$$

- output noise power

---

## Composite Noise Figure and Composite Noise Temperature

- [x] what is composite?
- [ ] what the design goals for the front end of the receiver

---

- composite noise figure for a sequnce of 2 stages

$$
F_{\text{comp}}=F_1+{F_2-1\over{G_1}}
$$

- composite noise figure for a sequnce of n stages

$$
F_{\text{comp}}=F_1+{F_2-1\over{G_1}}+{F_3-1\over{G_1G_2}}+\cdots+{F_n-1\over{G_1G_2\cdots G_{n-1}}}
$$

---

- composite effective noise temperature of a sequence of n stages

$$
T^\degree_{\text{comp}}=T^{\degree}_1+{T^{\degree}_2\over{G_1}}+{T^{\degree}_3\over{G_1G_2}}+\cdots+{T^{\degree}_n\over{G_1G_2\cdots G_{n-1}}}
$$

- noise figure of the lossy line

$$
F_{\text{comp}}=L=L(F-1)=LF
$$

- composite temperature of line and amplifier

$$
T^\degree=T^\degree
$$

### Comparison of Noise Figure and Noise Temperature

> since both characterize the noise performance of devices
>
> we select one of these measure as the more useful

- For terrestrial applications: $F$
- For space applications: $T^\degree$

## System Effective Temperature

- [x] what is system temperature
- [x] what difference is between noise temperature and system
- [x] why doesn't antenna and rest resources have the same sequential gain reduction factors?
- [x] what does we know from the system temperature

---

- antenna temperature: measure of the effective temperature integrated over the entire antenna pattern
- system temperature: adding together all the system noise contributiors (in terms of effective temperature)

$$
T^\degree_S=T^\degree_A+T^\degree_{\text{comp}}
$$

- $T^\degree_A$: antenna temperature
- $T^\degree_{\text{comp}}$: composite temperature of the line and the preamplifier

---

- provide
  - two primary sources of noise and interference at a receiver
  - one source characterized by $T^\degree_A$
    - degradation from the outside world arriving via the antenna
  - second source characterized by $T^\degree_{\text{comp}}$
    - thermal noise caused by the motion of electrons in all conductors
- antenna has no dissipative parts; its gain, unlike an amplifier or attenuator, can be thought of as a processing gain

## Sky Noise Temperature

- [x]: Why does we know sky?

---

### Sky?

#### sky background noise

- consisting of random noise from galatic, solar, and terrestrial sources
  - receiving antenna coollects

#### sky background

- combination of galatic effects and atmopheric effects
  - galatic effects: decrease with frequency
  - atmopheric effects: start becoming significant at 10 GHz and increase with frequency

---

### Radio Maps of the Sky

- [x]: Why use radio map?

- the map is effectively a weighted sum of the individual galactic source temperatures plus a constant sky background.
