## Introduction

### What is this book about?

- The ideas and techiniques fundamental to digital communication systems

### What is digital communication system(DCS)'s target?

- System design goals
- The need for trade-offs among basic system parameters
  - Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), probability of error, and bandwidth expenditure

---

### Why DCS?

- The ever-growing demand for data communication
- Digital transmission offers data processin options and dlexibilities not available with analog transmission

### What is DCS's objective?

- determines from a noise-perturbed signal which waveform from the finite set of waveforms was sent by the transmitter.

## Why Digital?

> versus analog

- Easy to regenerate digital signals
- Robustness to distortion and interference
- Reiablity
- Low cost to produce digital circuit
- Flexible implementation for digital hardware

### Cost?

- Signal-processing intensive
- Allocation a lot of resources for synchronization at various levels
- Nongraceful degradation

## Digital versus Analog Performance Criteria

- Difference
  - performance evaluation way
- Figure of merit
  - Analog: a fidelity criterion
    - signal-to-noise ratio
    - percent distortion
    - expected mean-square error
  - Digital
    - The probability of incorrectly detecting a digit
    - The probability of error
