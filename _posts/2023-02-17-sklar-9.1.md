## 9.1 Goals of The Communications System Designer

---

### Goal

- maximize transmission bit rate $R$
- minimize probability of bit error $P_B$
- minimize required power, or equivalently, to minimize required bit energy to noise power spectral density $E_b/N_0$
- minimize required system bandwidth $W$
- maximize system utilization
  - provide reliable service for a maximum number of users with minim delay and with maximum resistance to interference
- minimize system complexity, computational load, and system cost
- achieve al these goals simultaneously
  - conflit
    - goals 1 and 2
    - goals 3 and 4

---

### serveral constraints and theoretical limitations

- The Nyquist theoretical minimum bandwidth requirement
- The Shannon-Hartley capacity theorem (and the Shannon limit)
- Goverment requlations
- Technological limitations
- Other system requirements

---

### realizable modulation and coding trade-offs

- a change in operation point on one of two performance planes
  - the error probability plane
  - the bandwidth efficiency plane

## 9.2 Error Probability Plane

---

1. the potential bit error improvement with orthogonal signaling as $k$ or $M$ is increased
   1. an improvement in $P_B$, or reduction in the $E_b/N_0$ required, at the cost of increased bandwidth
2. potential bit error degradation with nonorthogoanl siganling as $k$ or $M$ increases
   1. increasing the size of the symbol set can reduce the bandwidth requirement, but at the cost of a degraded $P_B$, or an increaed $E_b/N_0$ requirement

---

- Error probability performance curves
- Error probability plane
- equibandwidth curves
  - curve associated with a different fixed minimum required bandwidth
- once a modulation and coding scheme and an availiable $E_b/N_o$ are determined, system operation is characterized by a particular point in the error probability plane

---

1. trading off between $P_B$ and $E_b/N_0$ performance (with $W$)
2. trading $P_B$ versus $W$ (with $E_b/N_0$ fixed)
3. trading $W$ versus $E_b/N_0$ (with $P_B$ fixed)
