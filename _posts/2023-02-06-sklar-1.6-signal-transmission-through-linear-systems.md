## Objective

- [x] What is relation between signal transmission and linear systems

---

## Introduction

- what are the characterization of systems
- what are their effects on such signals and noise

---

## Impulse Response

### Definition

> Characterizing a linear system in terms of its impulse response has a straightforward physical interpretation

- The response of the network to an arbitrary input signal $x(t)$

$$
y(t)=x(t)*h(t)=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x(\tau)h(t-\tau)d\tau
$$

### Causal

> No output prior to the time, $t=0$, when the input is applied.

$$
y(t)=x(t)*h(t)=\int^{\infty}_{0}x(\tau)h(t-\tau)d\tau
$$

---

## Frequency Transfer Function

### Convolution in the frequency domain

$$
Y(f)=X(f)H(F)
$$

### Frequency Transfer Function's Definition

> the Fourier transform of the impulse response function

$$
H(f)=\mathscr{F}\{h(t)\}
$$

---

### Random Processes and Linear Systems

> What is relation between random processes and linear systems

- A time-invariant linear system
  - input(random process) -> output(random process)
  - input(sample function) -> output(sample function)
  - input(power spectral density) -> output(power spectral density)

---

## Distortionless Transmission

> Why does we consider distorionless?
> What is advantage when transmission is distorionless?
> What is condition for distortionless?

$$
y(t)=Kx(t-t_0)
$$

$$
Y(f)=KX(f)e^{-j2\pi ft_0}
$$

system transfer function

$$
H(f)=Ke^{-j2\pi ft_0}
$$

---

### How to achieve?

- the overall system response must have a constant magnitude response
- its phase shift must be linear with frequency

- phase shift must be proportional to frequency in order for the time delay of all components to be identical

$$
t_0\text{ (seconds)}={\theta\text{ (radians)}\over{2\pi f\text{ (radians/second)}}}
$$

---

### What purpose to use?

- measure delay distortion of a siganl
  - envelope delay
  - group delay

$$
\tau(f)=-{1\over{2\pi}}{d\theta(f)\over{df}}
$$

---

### Ideal Filter

> what is ideal filter
>
>

- A truncated network that passes, without distortion, all frequency components between $f_l$ and $f_u$
  - $f_l$: the lower cutoff frequency
  - $f_u$: the upper cutoff frequency

---

#### Passband filter

> Outside the range $f_l<f<f_u$

#### Bandpass filter (BPF)

> $f_l\neq0 \text{ and } f_u\neq\infty$

#### Low-pass filter (LPF)

> $f_l=0 \text{ and } f_u$ has a finite value

#### Hight-pass filter (HPF)

> $f_l$ has a nonzero value and $f_u\rightarrow\infty$

---

#### Ideal low-pass filter

- Transfer function

$$
H(f)=|H(f)|e^{-j\theta(f)}
$$

- Impulse response

$$
\begin{split}
h(t)=\mathscr{F}^{-1}\{H(f)\}&=\int^\infty_{-\infty}H(f)e^{j2\pi ft}df\\
&=\int^{f_u}_{-f_u}e^{-j2\pi ft_0}e^{j2\pi ft}df\\
&=\int^{f_u}_{-f_u}e^{j2\pi f(t-t_0)}df\\
&=2f_u{\sin{2\pi f_u(t-t_0)}\over{2\pi f_u(t-t_0)}}\\
&=2f_u\text{sinc}{2f_u(t-t_0)}
\end{split}
$$

---

- Not relizable
- the impulse response is noncausal

---

### Realizable Filters

- [ ] What is relation with ideal filter
  - [ ] approximations to the ideal low-pass filter characteristic
    - [ ] the Butterworth filter
- [ ] What does we know from the example
  - [ ] real practical example: RC filter

---

#### RC filter

> The very simplest example of a realizable low-pass filter

##### Transfer function

$$
H(f)={1\over{1+j2\pi f\mathscr{R}C}}={1\over{\sqrt{1+(2\pi f\mathscr{R}C)^2}}}e^{-j\theta(f)}
$$

- $\theta(f)=\tan^{-1}{2\pi f\mathscr{R}C}$
- verify that the half-power point of the low-pass RC filter corresponds to $\omega=1/\mathscr{R}C$ radians per second or $f=1/(2\pi \mathscr{R}C)$ hertz

---

#### The low-pass filter

- bandwidth: half-power point
- half-power point
  - this point is the frequency at which the output signal power has fallen to one-half of its peak value
  - the frequency at which the magnitude of the output voltage has fallen to $1/\sqrt{2}$ of its peak value

$$
\text{number of dB}=10\log_{10}{P_2\over{P_1}}=10\log_{10}{V^2_2/\mathscr{R}_2\over{V^2_1/\mathscr{R}_1}}
$$

---

- For communication systems
  - normalized power is generally used for analysis
  - $\mathscr{R}_1$ and $\mathscr{R}_2$ are set equal to 1 $\Omega$

$$
\text{number of dB}=10\log_{10}{P_2\over{P_1}}=10\log_{10}{V^2_2\over{V^2_1}}
$$

- The amplitude response in decibels

$$
|H(f)|_{\text{dB}}=20\log_{10}{V_2\over{V_1}}=20\log_{10}{|H(f)|}
$$

---

#### The Butterworth filter

> useful approximations to the ideal low-pass filter characteristic

$$
|H_n(f)|={1\over{\sqrt{1+(f/f_u)^{2n}}}}
$$
