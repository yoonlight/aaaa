## Introduction

- satellite repeaters
  - retransmit the messages they receive
- regenerative repeater
  - regenerates (demodulates and resonstitutes) the digital information embedded in the received waveforms before retransmission
- nonregenerative repeater
  - only amplifies and retransmits
- link analysis for a regenerative satellite repeater
  - treat the uplink and downlink as two separate point-to-point analyses

---

- overall bit error performance of a regenerative repeater link
  - the bit error probability on the uplink and downlink
    - $P_u$: the bit error probability on the uplink
    - $P_d$: the bit error probability on the downlink

$$
P_c=(1-P_u)(1-P_d)+P_uP_d
P_B=1-P_c=P_u+P_d-2P_uP_d
$$

- For low values of $P_u$ and $P_d$

$$
P_B\approx P_u+P_d
$$
