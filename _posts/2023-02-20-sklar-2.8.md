## 2.8.3 Spectral Attributes of PCM Waveforms

### Spectral characteristics

- Criteria
  - for comparing PCM waveforms
  - for selecting one waveform type from the many available
- The spectral characteristics of a PCM waveform
  - Bit synchronization capabilities
  - Error-detecting capabilities
  - Interference
  - Noise immunity
  - Cost and complexity of implementation

---

- Normalized bandwidth: $WT$
  - The ratio of the bandwidth of a PCM waveform to the bandwidth of a corresponding binary waveform
- The units of normalized bandwidth
  - How efficiently the transmission bandwidth is being utilized for each waveform of interest
- $R/W$ (units of $bits/sec/Hz$)
  - An important parameter for measuring bandwidth efficiency
  - involves data rate rather than symbol rate
  - how much data throughput can be transmitted for each Hertz of available bandwidth

## 2.8.4 Bits per PCM Word and Bits per Symbol

- PCM word size
  - the number of quantization levels allowed for each sample
- Quantization
  - the number of bits required to identify that set of levels
- Symbol $M=2^k$
- PCM $L=2^{\mathcal{l}}$
  - $L$: number of quantization levels
  - $\mathcal{l}$: number of bits needed to represent those levels

---

### 2.8.4.1 PCM Word Size

- How many bits shall we assign to each analog sample?
- The choice of the number of levels, or bits per sample
  - how much quantization distorion we are willing to tolerate with the PCM format

$$
|e|\leq\ p V_{pp}
$$

- $|e|$: magnitude of quantization distortion error
- $p$: praction
- $V_{pp}$: peak-to-peak analog voltage

---

$$
|e|_{\text{max}}=\frac{q}{2}=\frac{V_{pp}}{2(L-1)}\approx\frac{V_{pp}}{2L}
$$

- $q$: quantization interval
- $L$: number of quantization levels

$$
\mathcal{l}=\log_2\frac{1}{2p}\quad\text{bits}
$$

## 2.8.5 M-ary Pulse Modulation Waveforms

- Three basic ways to modulate information on to a sequence of pulses
  - amplitude (PAM)
  - position (PPM)
  - duration (PDM)
    - width (PWM)

---

- Analog pulse modulation
  - The resulting pulse modulation when information samples without any quantization are modulated on to pulses
- M-ary pulse modulation
  - When the information samples are first quantized, yielding symbols from an M-ary alphabet set, and then modulated on to pulses, the resulting pulse modulation is digital

---

- PAM
  - one of M allowable amplitude levels are assigned to each of the M possible symbol values???
- PPM
  - Modulation effected by **delaying a pulse occurrence**
- PDM
  - Modulation effected by **varing the pulse width** by an amount

---

### Bandwidth reduction

#### Background

- Transmission bandwidth required for binary digital waveforms such as PCM may be very large

#### Solution: Multilevel signaling

- Instead of transmitting a pulse waveform for each bit, we might first partition the data into k-bit groupds and then use $(M=2^k)$-level pulses for transmission

---

#### Cost for bandwidth reduction

Task of the pulse receiver

- distinguish between the possible levels of each pulse
- the transmission of an 8-level pulse requires **a greater amount of energy** for equivalent detection performance
- for equal average power in the binary and the octal pulses, it is easier to detect the binary pulses
- binary PCM's price of needing three times as much transmission bandwidth for a given data rate, compared with octal pulses
- why not use binary pulses with the same pulse duration as the original octal pulses and suffer the information delay
  - an increase in delay cannot be tolerated
