## 2.8.1 Waveform Representation of Binary Digits

- physical
  - electrical pulse in order to transmit them through a baseband channel

---

## 2.8.2 PCM Waveform Types

### Baseband Signaling

- Pulse-code modulation (PCM) waveform
  - The resulting binary waveform when pulse modulation is applied to a binary symbol
    - in telephony applications, line codes
- M-ary pulse-modulation waveform
  - The resulting waveform when pulse modulation is applied to a nonbinary symbol

---

### PCM waveforms groups

#### Nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ)

- NRZ-L (L for level)
  - used in digital logic circuits
  - there is a change in level whenever the data change froma one to zero or from a zero to a one

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/NRZ-L.png)

---

- NRZ-M (M for mark)
  - the one, or mark is represented by a change in level
  - the zero, or space is represented by no change in level
  - differential encoding
  - used in magnetic tape recording
  - 10110001101

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/NRZ-M.png)

---

- NRZ-S (S for space)
  - the complement of NRZ-M
  - one is represented by no change in level
  - zero is represented by a change in level
  - 10110001101

#### Return-to-zero (RZ)

application in baseband data transmission and in magnetic recoding

- unipolar-RZ
  - one is represented by a half-bit-wide puse
  - zero is represented by the absence of a pulse
  - 10110001101

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/Unipolar_RZ.png)

---

- bipolar-RZ
  - ones and zeros are represented by opposite-level pulse that are one-half bit wide
  - 10110001101

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/Bipolar_RZ.png)

---

- RZ-AMI (alternate mark inversion)
  - a signaling scheme used in telephone systems
  - ones are represented by equal-amplitude alternating pulses
  - zeros are represented by the absence of pulses

---

#### Phase encoded

used in magnetic recoding systems and optical communications and in some sattelite telemetry links

- bi-phase-level
  - manchester coding
  - one is represented by a half-bt-wide pulse positioned during the first half of the bit interval
  - a zero is represented by a half-bit-wide pulse positioned during the second half of the bit interval

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/Bi-phase-L.png)

---

- bi-phase-mark
  - a transition occurs at the beginning of every bit interval
  - a one is represented by a second transition one-half bit interval later
  - a zero is represented by no second transition

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/Bi-phase-M.png)

---

- bi-phase-space
  - a transition also occurs at the beginning of ebery bit interval
  - a one is represented by no second transition
  - a zero is represented by a second transition one-half bit interval later

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/Bi-phase-S.png)

---

- delay modulation
  - miller coding
  - a one is represented by a transition at the mid point of the bit interval
  - a zero is represented by no transition, unless it is followed by another zero

![center](../assets/images/sklar/2/Delay-modulation.png)

---

#### Multilevel binary

- Bipolar RZ
- RZ-AMI
- dicode-NRZ
  - the one-to-zero or zero-to-one transition produces a half-duration polarity change
  - otherwise, zero level is sent

- dicode-RZ

- duobinary

---

- the differences in performance that characterize each waveform
  - DC component
    - the system to be ac coupled
  - Self-Clocking
    - some pcm coding schemes have inherent synchronizing or clocking features that aid in the recovery of the clock signal
  - Error detection
    - provide the means of detecting data errors without introducing additional error-detection bits
  - Bandwidth compression
    - increase the efficiency of bandwidth utilization by allowing a reduction in required bandwidth for a given data rate
  - Differential encoding
  - Noise immunity

---

## 2.8.3 Spectral Attributes of PCM Waveforms

- spectral characteristics
  - bit synchronization capabilities
  - error-detecting capabilities
  - interference
  - noise immunity
  - cost and complexity of implementation

---

- the units of normalized bandwidth
  - how efficiently the transmission bandwidth is being utilized for each waveform of interest

---

- An important parameter for measuring bandwidth efficiency
  - data rate rather than symbol rate
  - R/W describes how much data throughput can be transmitted for each Hertz of available bandwidth

## 2.8.4 Bits per PCM Word and Bits per Symbol

### 2.8.4.1 PCM Word Size

---

## 2.8.5 M-ary Pulse Modulation Waveforms

- three basic ways to modulate information on to a sequence of pulses
  - amplitude (PAM)
  - position (PPM)
  - duration (PDM)
    - width (PWM)

---

- analog pulse modulation
  - when information samples without any quantization are modulated on to pulses, the resulting pulse modulation
- M-ary pulse modulation
  - when the information samples are first quantized, yielding symbols from an M-ary alphabet set, and then modulated on to pulses, the resulting pulse modulation is digital

---

- PAM
  - one of M allowable amplitude levels are assigned to each of the M possible symbol values
- PPM
  - modulation is effected by delaying a pulse occurrence
- PDM
  - modulation is effected by varing the pulse width by an amount

---

- Baseband modulation with pulses have analogous counterparts in the area of bandpass modulation

---

- the transmission bandwidth required for binary digital waveforms such as PCM may be very large
- reduce the required bandwidth?
  - use multilevel signaling
    - instead of transmitting a pulse waveform for each bit, we might first partition the data into k-bit groupds and then use (M=2^k)-level pulses for transmission

---

### Task of the pulse receiver

- distinguish between the possible levels of each pulse
- the transmission of an 8-level pulse requires a greater amount of energy for equivalent detection performance
- for equal average power in the binary and the octal pulses, it is easier to detect the binary pulses
- binary PCM's price of needing three times as much transmission bandwidth for a given data rate, compared with octal pulses
- why not use binary pulses with the same pulse duration as the original octal pulses and suffer the information delay
  - an increase in delay cannot be tolerated
