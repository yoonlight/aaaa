## Introduction

### Channel

- the propagating medium or electromagnetic path connecting the transmitter and receiver

- for most terrestrial coomunication links
  - the channel space is occupied by the atmosphere and partially bounded by the earth' surface
- **for satellite links**
  - the channel is occupied mostly by **empty space**

## The Concept of Free Space

---

### Assumption

- A channel free of all hindrances to RF propagation
- The earth is infinitely far away.
- Its reflection coefiicient is negligible.
- The free-space channel characterizes an ideal RF propagation path.

## Error-Performance Degradation

---

- We are concerned with the bookkeeping of the gains and losses for signal power and interfering power.
- Error performance depends on the received $E_b/N_0$.

$$
{E_b\over{N_0}}={S\over{N}}({W\over{R}})
$$

### The SNR can degrade in two ways

1. Loss: through the decrease of the desired signal power
   1. Losses occur when a portion of the signal is absorbed, diverted, scattered, or reflected along its route to the intented receiver
2. Noise: through the increase of noise power
3. Interference: the increase of interfering signal power
   1. Serveral sources of interfering electrical noise and intterference produced by a variety of mechanisms and sources.
