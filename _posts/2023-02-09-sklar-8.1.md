## Introduction

### Summary

- What is Reed-Solomon codes
- What does the equation of these codes mean
- What are the advantages of these codes

---

## Reed-Solomon Error Probability

### Check Previous Chapter

- burst-error correction
- channels that have memory
- a small power of the block length

---

### Symbol Error Probability

$$
P_E\approx {1\over{2^m-1}}\sum^{2^m-1}_{j=t+1}j
\left(
\begin{matrix}
  2^m-1\\
  j
\end{matrix}
\right)
p^j(1-p)^{2^m-1-j}
$$

- $t$: the symbol-error correcting capabilit of the code

### The relationship between $P_B$ and $P_E$

$$
{P_E\over{P_E}}={2^{m-1}\over{2^m-1}}
$$

---

- error probability is an exponentially decreasing function of block length, $n$
- decoding complexity is proportional to a small power of the block length

## Why R-S Codes Perform Well Against Burst Noise

### Previous Chapter

- [Burst Noise](http://www.ktword.co.kr/test/view/view.php?nav=2&no=1275&sh=burst+noise)
  - 데이터 전송시, 한 무리의 데이터에 집단적으로 오류가 발생

### Answer

- when a decoder corrects a byte, it replaces the incorrect byte with the correct one, whether the error was caused by on bit being corrupted or all 8 bits being corrupted

---

## R-S Performance as a Function of Size, Redunancy, and Code Rate

### Code Block Size

- error-correcting codes become more efficient as the code block size increases

### Redundancy

- the benefit of increased redundancy is the improvement in bit-error performance

### Code Rate

- Optimum code rates minimize the required $E_b/N_0$
- There is $E_b/N_0$ degradation for very large rates and very low rates

---

#### The degradation at high rates compared with the optimum rate

- Any code generally provides a coding gain benefit; thus as the code rate approaches unity (no coding), the system will suffer worse error performance

#### The degradation at low rates compared with the optimum rate

- coding to improve error performance
- degrading error performance is the energy reduction per channel symbol which stems from the increased redundancy
  - the reduced symbol energy causes the demoulator to make more errors

## Finite Fields

### Why do we know finite fields

- to understand the encoding and decoding priciples of nonbinary codes, such as a R-S codes

### Galois Fields (GF)

- Finite field: $GF(p)$
- An extension field of $GF(p)$: $GF(p^m)$
  - $GF(2^m)$ are used in the construction of R-S codes

---

### Infinite set of elements $F$

- it is formed by starting with the elements $\{0,1,\alpha\}$ and generating additional elements by progressively multiplying the last entry by $\alpha$

$$
F=\{0,1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots,\alpha^j,\cdots\}=\{0,\alpha^0,\alpha^1,\alpha^2,\cdots,\alpha^j,\cdots\}
$$

- to obtain the finite set of elements of $GF(2^m)$ from $F$, a condition must be imposed on $F$ so that it may contain only $2^m$ elements and is closed under multiplication
  - the condition is characterized by the irreducible polynomial

$$
\alpha^{(2^m-1)}+1=0
$$

- using this polynomial constraint, any field element that has a pwoer equal to or greater than $2^m-1$ can be reduced to an element with a power less than $2^m-1$

$$
\alpha^{2^m+n}=\alpha^{(2^m-1)}\alpha^{n+1}=\alpha^{n+1}
$$

---

- finite sequence $F^*$

$$
\begin{split}
F^*&=\{0,1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots,\alpha^{2^m-2},\alpha^{2^m-1},\alpha^{2^m},\cdots\}\\
  &=\{0,1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots,\alpha^{2^m-2},\alpha^{0},\alpha^{1},\alpha^{2},\cdots\}
\end{split}
$$

- the elements of the finite field $GF(2^m)$

$$
GF(2^m)=\{0,\alpha^0,\alpha^1,\alpha^2,\cdots,\alpha^{2^m-2}\}
$$

---

### Addition in the Extension Field

#### Representation of the finite field $GF(2^m)$

- Each of the $2^m$ elements of the finite field $GF(2^m)$ can be represented as **a distinct polynomial of degree m-1 or less**

$$
\alpha^i=a_i(X)=a_{i,0}+a_{i,1}X+a_{i,2}X^2+\cdots+a_{i,m-1}X^{m-1}
$$

#### The benefit of using extension field elements $\{\alpha^i\}$

- the compact notation that facilitates **the mathemeatical representation of nonbinary encoding and decoding processes**
- Addition of two elements of the finite field
  - **the modulo-2 sum** of each of the polynomial coefficients of like powers

$$
\alpha^i+\alpha^j=(a_{i,0}+a_{j,0})+(a_{i,1}+a_{j,1})X+\cdots+(a_{i,m-1}+a_{j,m-1})X^{m-1}
$$

---

### A Primitive Polynomial is Used to Define the Finte Field

- A class of polynomials (primitive polynomials) define the finite fields of $GF(2^m)$ which in turn are needed to define R-S codes.

#### Condition that a polynomial is primitive

- An irreducible polynomial, $f(X)$, of degree $m$ is said to be primitive, if the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f(X)$ divides $X^n+1$ is $n=2^m-1$

### A Simple Test to Determine if a Polynomial is Primitive

- For an irreducible polynomial to be a primitive polynomial, at least one of its roots must be a primitive element

---

## Reed-Solomon Encoding

### The generating polynomial for an R-S code

$$
\mathbf{g}(X)=g_0+g_1X+g_2X^2+\cdots+g_{2t-1}X^{2t-1}+X^{2t}
$$

- the degree of the generator polynomial is equal to the number of parity symbols
- root of $\mathbf{g}(X)$: $\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots,\alpha^{2t}$

---

### Encoding in Systematic Form

$$
X^{n-k}\mathbf{m}(X)=\mathbf{q}(X)\mathbf{g}(X)+\mathbf{p}(X)
$$

- $\mathbf{q}(X)$: quotient polynomials
- $\mathbf{p}(X)$: remainder polynomials

---

### Systematic Encoding with an $(n-k)$-Stage Shift Register

---

## Reed-Solomon Decoding

- the received corrupted-codeword polynomial

$$
\mathbf{r}(X)=\mathbf{U}(X)+\mathbf{e}(X)
$$
