## Communication Link

- communications link's range
  - the link encompasses the entire commuinications path

---

### Link Analysis

- It is consist of the calculations and tabulation of the useful signal power and the interfering noise power available at the receiver

### Purpose

- To determine the actual system operating point
- To establish that error probability associated with that point is less than or equal to the system requirement

---

## Link Budget

- Balance sheet of gains and losses
- it outlines the detailed apportionment of transmission and reception resources, noise sources, signal attenuators, and effects of processes through the link
- Estimation technique for evaluating communication system error performance

### Provide

- overall system insight
- overall system design and performance
